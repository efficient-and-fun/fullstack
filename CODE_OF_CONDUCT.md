# **EF – Efficient and Fun** Code of Conduct

At **EF – Efficient and Fun**, we believe that great teamwork is built on efficiency, collaboration, and enjoyment. This Code of Conduct serves as a guide for how we work together to ensure smooth processes and a positive team environment.

## **Collaboration & Communication**
We treat each other with respect and communicate in a constructive and solution-oriented way. Decisions should be well-documented and accessible to all team members. Feedback is always encouraged, as long as it is given respectfully and with the goal of improving our work. While efficiency is key, we also value a fun and enjoyable team atmosphere.

## **Kanban Process & Resource Planning**
Our Kanban board is structured into the following buckets:  

- **Backlog**: Tasks that are planned but not yet started.  
- **Blocked**: Tasks that cannot progress due to external dependencies.  
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.  
- **In Review**: Tasks that have been completed and are awaiting review.  
- **Done**: Completed tasks that meet all requirements.  

To maintain a clear overview of workload distribution, resource planning is managed in an Excel sheet and must be updated at least two days before a new sprint begins.

## **Version Control & Git Workflow**
We have two repositories, one for the frontend and one for the backend. Our branching model consists of three main branches:  

- **main** (protected)  
- **dev** (protected)
- **dev-frontend** (protected)
- **dev-backend** (protected)  
- **feature** branches for new developments  

Feature branches follow a strict naming convention:  
`[issue-number]-[lowercase-description-with-hyphens]` (e.g., `42-login-endpoint`).  

Pull requests require at least one review before being merged, and all commits on the `dev` branch must be squashed before merging. At the end of each sprint, the **dev** branch is released to **main**, ensuring that only stable and tested code reaches production.

## **Meetings & Organization**
Regular meetings are held to align the team, and decisions are properly documented. Every team member is responsible for updating their availability and planned work in the resource planning Excel sheet as early as possible. Although we focus on efficiency, we make sure to maintain a positive and engaging work environment.  

After all, **EF stands for Efficient and Fun!**
