## 1. Introduction and Goals
Our event planning app aims to provide an intuitive platform for both private and public events.
Created events should be bookable for individual users. Additionally, users can create and join

plan the event within these friend groups.

Many event planning tools lack seamless coordination between individual and group event
management. Users often struggle with disorganized planning, scattered communication, and
difficulty in keeping track of event details. Our app addresses these challenges by offering:
